# Bitcoin, Web3, me and Nostr
The first draft of this text was published on [Yakihonne](https://yakihonne.com/article/naddr1qq2hgdfe09a9v3nhvae5jaz8v56yjepkvdm4yq3qm78s5eqv8l7snc5nnxdvlgue6pt5epgplndtem99quhwyptas7jsxpqqqp65w5c0e84). It has been supplemented, revised and saved here as a backup.

## Introduction.
I think the approximate time is correct, but the exact time is quite fuzzy (slightly updated on 15 Dec), so this text may be the megalomania of a middle-aged man. Please also note that if anyone who understands me reads this text, they will know who I am. Even if you find out, please leave him alone and think he's bored.

## Meeting and parting with bitcoin
I first owned bitcoin when I met Coincheck (then known as Rejepress), between 2012 and 2014, I remember!

My job at the time was in venture capital. Venture capitalists invest in fast-growing start-ups and then profit when the company goes public or is acquired.

There are many conditions for a growing start-up, but one essential factor is that the market the company is targeting must be growing. Back then, news of the Mt. Gox hack was on TV, and bitcoin and other virtual currencies (before they were called cryptocurrencies) were becoming known to innovators and beyond. It was a time when

I had the opportunity to meet the then CEO, Mr Wada, just as I was thinking about investing in an exchange that would be the gateway to bitcoin, with the growth of tech bureaus Zaif and Bitflyer at my side. I asked him to let me invest in the company. I want to thank Mr Wada again.

As a lowly employee, I had no authority to make investment decisions, so I said, "You should invest in Coincheck! Because..." As part of my preparation, I opened a Coincheck account and, with some nervousness, made my first bitcoin purchase. After deliberation by the investment committee, the investment was abandoned (Coincheck has since grown into something of a mountain lion, not a unicorn) and I was left with nothing but bitcoins.

Despite my disappointment, bitcoin's market capitalisation has continued to grow and it has become such a hot topic that images of "just sleep and wake up in the morning to find your money growing" are circulating.

Then, as it became a big news story, there was a NEM (XEM) leak at Coincheck on a scale unparalleled in the world.

At the time of the incident, I had already left VC, but while working on a new business there, I asked Mr Otsuka, who was a director of Coincheck at the time, if he could provide an OEM cryptocurrency exchange, and immediately afterwards, I well remember the people gathering outside his office and the press conference where he was incessantly denounced.

Although I was rooting for Coincheck in the midst of all the hard things, it is also true that I was disappointed by the vulnerability of the exchange as a gateway to bitcoin If a bullet train tunnel or station can easily collapse, it can no longer be a major artery I closed all my positions at the time, withdrew my Japanese yen and closed my account.

By then I had made enough profit to say goodbye to bitcoin with no regrets.

## Hopes and disappointments with Web3
About three years later, I was in New Zealand when I was approached by a group of young entrepreneurs.

Web3, DAOs, smart contracts?

I'd been away from VC and cryptocurrency for a while, so it was hard to digest all the information I hadn't caught up with, but I thought about what it could mean for the future (not to mention the 3 guys who would go on to found [Fracton Venturs](https://fracton.ventures/en/about)) and felt hopeful about the system they were betting their lives on. I did.

What gave me hope was the memory of talking to Mr Mezaki, the author of 'Nippon, a Happy Developing Country - Proposals to Reborn as a New Nation' (Mr Mesaki kept me for over an hour in his busy weekday lunchtime schedule). (Mr K introduced Mr Mesaki to me and said that I should meet him once before I left Japan. Thank you very much).

The correlation between autonomy and happiness is 20 times greater than the correlation between income and happiness.

Smart contracts that can be objectively verified by anyone, transparency is ensured and fairness (NOT equality) is ensured because they are automatically enforced DAOs where everyone voluntarily contributes to the organisation that uses them as rules.

It is not easy to change the country you live in, and therefore not easy to change the culture you live in!

Unfortunately, the subsequent Web3 did not turn out as I had imagined, and I won't list every single case, but my conclusion is that 'humanity is not ready for Web3'.

I hope that one day Web3 and its peripheral technologies will not aim to solve problems that don't exist, but to be the best solution to problems that do exist, and that one day the ideals of the DAO will be realised as they should be.

## Down the rabbit hole
In March 2021, I return to Japan, leaving my family behind.

Alone at home, I have free time outside of work. When I'm free, I do social networking, but Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have already become spaces that resemble the real world with the arrival of the late majority!

Isn't that something?

Then I was lucky enough to join [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), a decentralised social networking site, via Waitlist. I was enjoying the early Twitter-like space, for innovators and early adopters only, when I noticed a group of active people talking about something called Nostr.

I searched for the word [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) and found [Damus](https://damus.io/), a social networking site where Japanese people are active, so I thought I'd check it out.

I fell into the muddy waters of Chinese spam and was pulled back to shore, where I am now.

## Reconnecting with bitcoin and reigniting expectations
Although I have a number of social networking sites, I now spend most of my time on Nostr.

One of the reasons I spend so much time on Nostr, as a non-developer, is that I only feel comfortable with innovators and early adopters, but also because of the Zap system (bitcoin is what we exchange on Zap, and it's a great way to reconnect with bitcoin! I never thought I'd see bitcoin here again!) and because I see potential in Nostr as a higher level of bitcoin.

The source of Bitcoin's value, like any other legal tender, is people's trust in it!

Some people criticise it for being virtual and fictional, but to me its value feels much more plausible than the value of a start-up determined by a few VCs (and calculated by combining preferred and common shares), and the fact that so many people across borders trust it, as if it were a 'lingua franca of humanity'. It's romantic.

The exchange of value and sentiment on Nostr with Zap is, if I may use an analogy, like the good old crowdfunding (in which I invested as a VC) exchange of capital with sentiment.

The combination of Nostr's and Bitcoin's system, which cannot be changed by third parties, the communication with feelings of value and the OSS culture in which each participant tries to contribute, shows us once again the dream of "voluntary and independent action and the resulting happiness" that we once saw in Web3 and DAO. It is being shown to us again.

## At the end of the day
I wrote what I was thinking about with a lot of energy on the train on the way home.

I'm dreaming about Nostr now, but maybe in six months I'll be disappointed, or maybe I'll be more into it.

I can still count on one hand, but I've registered an account on Github, I've raised issues, I've donated the sats I've received to the OpenSats Nostr Fund...

I hope to be able to do a bit more of what I can and have done next year. If you can wish, you can certainly move!
